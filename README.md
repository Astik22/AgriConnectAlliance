# AgriConnectAlliance
MY journey in developing AgriConnectAlliance: Enhancing Agricultural Trade and Farmer Welfare has been a truly transformative experience. Together, I worked on creating a platform that connects farmers directly with buyers to streamline agricultural trade and improve livelihoods.

Key highlights of our project:

- Ensuring farmers have access to accurate Minimum Support Prices (MSP)

- Providing real-time weather updates for better farming decisions

- Simplifying navigation through government policies

- Strengthening the farmer-buyer network to drive fair trade

- Providing agriculture products and crops at low prices

- Establishing farmer to farmer connection

- Expert's solution to the farmers facing problems

- Video tutorials for more understanding

- Insurance facilities are provided to the farmers

- Soil testing for better yield of the crop
